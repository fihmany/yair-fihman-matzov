hello As she lay in her berth, staring atthe shadows overhead, the rush of the wheels was in her brain, driving her deeper and deeper into circles of wakeful lucidity.
The sleeping-car had sunk into its night-silence.
Through the wet window-pane she watched the sudden lights, the long stretches of hurrying blackness.
Now and then she turned her head and looked through the opening in the hangings at her husband's curtains bottom across the aisle.

She wondered restlessly if he wanted anything and if she could hear him if he called.
His voice had grown very weak within the last months and it irritated him when she did not hear.
This irritability, this increasing childish petulance seemed to give expression to their imperceptible estrangement.
Like two faces looking at one another through a sheet of glass they were close together, almost touching, but they could not hear or feel each other: the conductivity between them was broken.
She, at least, had this sense of separation, and she fancied sometimes that she saw it reflected in the look with which he supplemented his failing words.
